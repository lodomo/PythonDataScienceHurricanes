## General Background

This dataset provides a comprehensive historical background on tropical cyclones, including hurricanes and typhoons, spanning from 1970 to 2024. It consists of detailed observations that allow for tracking the complete life cycle of individual storms, capturing their paths and changes in intensity over time. Key information recorded for each storm includes its name, a unique identifier, its precise geographical coordinates, the ocean basin of its activity, and critical intensity metrics such as maximum sustained wind speed and minimum central atmospheric pressure.
